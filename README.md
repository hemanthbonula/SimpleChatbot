SimpleChatbot

A lightweight, console-based chatbot built in Python with basic NLP-style pattern matching.
Designed as a starting point to evolve into an intelligent conversational agent.

Usage:
    python simple_chatbot.py             # Run the chatbot
    python simple_chatbot.py --readme    # Print the embedded README to terminal
    python simple_chatbot.py --bootstrap # Emit README.md and LICENSE (MIT) to disk

Example interaction:
    You: hello
    Bot: Hi there!
    You: what is your name
    Bot: I am SimpleChatbot.
    You: bye
    Bot: Goodbye!

Features:
- Pattern-based response matching (regex)
- Console interaction
- Conversation logging
- Bootstrap README and license

Future improvements:
- NLP preprocessing (tokenization, intent detection)
- Learning from unknown inputs
- Configurable patterns via JSON/YAML
- Web/GUI front end

A lightweight, console-based chatbot built in Python with basic NLP-style pattern matching.  
Designed as a starting point to evolve into an intelligent conversational agent.

## üéØ Overview

SimpleChatbot lets users interact via the terminal. It matches user input against patterns and responds with predefined replies. This project is intentionally minimal so you can extend it with real NLP, learning, or integration layers.

## ‚ú® Features

- Pattern-based response matching (regex)
- Console interaction (no GUI dependencies)
- Conversation logging
- Easily extensible

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hemantharjun65/SimpleChatbot.git
   cd SimpleChatbot
